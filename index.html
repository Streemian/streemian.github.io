<h2>Shutdown of Streemian.com</h2>

<p>Due to lack of time and resources, as well as a growing dissatisfactory
about the reliability and availability of the services among customers, we are
taking down Streemian, indefinitely.</p>

<p>The login will be kept available, as well as the Lock/Unlock App, so people
can safely remove authorization to post on their behalf from their account.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we would like to thank everyone for the support and
assistance we've reached throughout the last 2 years. It was a pleasant ride
and we hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>
<br/>
<p>-- ChainSquad GmbH Management</p>
